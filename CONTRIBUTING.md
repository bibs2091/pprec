# Contributing in pprec
Hello! we would appreciate your contribution to this open source project. To make sure it is compatible with our existing code and future plans, kindly follow these guidelines:

## Adding a feature/functionality
It is preferable to create an issue with the name of the feature and the details of it. When the feature is approved by one pprec team members you can proceed with the pull request. This will help us manage the project in case we are already working on a similar idea or your feature does not align with our future plans.

## Fixing a bug
Similar to adding features, you should also write up the bug details in an issue, then create a pull request to solve it. You do not need a member's approval of the issue to work around solving it.

# Code reviews
All submissions except project members require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.
